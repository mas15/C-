Project needs C++ 11.
Standard libraries I used are: iostream, vector, sstream, math, chrono and thread.

Command to build console version is:

    g++ -std=c++11 Grid.cpp RobotReadings.cpp main.cpp

To run graphical interface my code requires library allegro version 5
To build GUI version:

    g++ -std=c++11 -lallegro -lallegro_primitives Grid.cpp RobotReadings.cpp guiMain.cpp

Example input files that are in a folder are "poses.txt" and "ranges.txt".

There is no specific environment on which code needs to be run. It can be run on Windows, Linux or OS X.

Project files:

1. Grid.h and Grid.cpp

    These files includes Grid class and Cell structure.

    Grid class represents a grid of cells.
    Class consists of two-dimensional array of cellIndexType.

2. RobotReadings.h and RobotReadings.cpp

    These files include RobotReadings structure.
    It consists of robot coordinates,
    degree of rotation and a vector of sensor readings.

3. Coordinate.h

    This file stores Coordinate structure.

4. main.cpp

    It is a file that has got main() function.
    It creates new Grid object, fills it with data read from files that are provided by user and displays a grid.

5. poses.txt and ranges.txt

    These are example files of poses and ranges.

6. OUTPUT

    This is an example of the output. ( “animation” saved in a text file )
