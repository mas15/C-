## Permuted Index
My first program with vectors. I guess that could be done better. There are two ways of solving a problem. One is mine and second one is alrogithm that was recommended in the book.

Task is:
Design and implement a program to produce a permuted index from the following input. A permuted index is one in which each phrase is indexed by every word in the phrase.
For input 

        "The quick brown fox jumped over the fence"
Should be an output:

         The quick      brown fox 
    jumped over the     fence
    The quick brown     fox 
                        jumped over the fence
             jumped     over the fence
                The     quick brown fox 
        jumped over     the fence
                        The quick brown fox
